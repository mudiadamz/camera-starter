Again it's just starter for working with camera on Android devices, because it's hard working with camera in android, it requires lot of codes, this is some sort of template. Clone this repo and do whatever you want, it's already include:
- Camera preview, switch front and rear
- Save picture to external storage
- Preview picture
- Zoom in picture
- Delete
