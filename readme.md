It's just starter for working with camera on Android devices, because it's hard working with camera from scratch in android, it took me days for just using the simplest libraries available, it requires lot of codes, this is some sort of template. Clone this repo and do whatever you want, it's already include:
- Camera preview, switch front and rear
- Save picture to external storage
- Preview picture
- Zoom in picture
- Delete
